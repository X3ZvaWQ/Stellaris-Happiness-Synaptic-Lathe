## Overview

This mod removes the **"Genocidal"** or **"Purging our Species"** diplomatic opinion penalties when players send their **Owner Species** into the **Synaptic Lathe** for eternal bliss.

As a newcomer to Stellaris, I started my journey by following [Zui Rou Xue's](https://space.bilibili.com/298047968) [tutorials](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1VdhvzDEUz). Even though there are some version discrepancies, I was eager to start a few games. However, I almost ended up in a "Total War" against the entire galaxy just because of the Lathe's diplomatic fallout.

Seriously—what's wrong with sending my own citizens in for some "pleasure"? It makes no sense for the galaxy to intervene! I couldn't find a mod on the Workshop that addressed this specific logic, so I decided to DIY it.

### Features
- **Balanced & Logical**: Processing your **Owner Species** (including your released vassals) in the Synaptic Lathe will no longer trigger genocidal diplomatic penalties. 
- **Consequences Remain**: Purging/Processing *other* alien species will still trigger the usual genocidal penalties.
- **Compatibility**: Designed for Stellaris 4.2+ (Requires *The Machine Age* DLC).
- **Save Game Compatible**: Can be added to existing save games.
